#INFORMATIONS ABOUT P4 PROGRAMMING
This README describe the structure of a p4 program and how it works (with reference to the p4 part in the project).

I'm using this page to structure this readme and the documentation of the p4 comunity:
+ https://opennetworking.org/news-and-events/blog/getting-started-with-p4/
+ https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html

First of all we need to create a file with the extension ".p4" which is the file where we will code our program.

Inside it, we will describe the structure of our architecture:

+ what libraries it includes
+ what type of header our program can handle, describing them
+ what functions our switch will apply to the packets (e.g., my_parser(), my_verify_checksum(), my_ingress() etc...)

After that, we need to compile it creating two different files:

+ the JSON file which is file the switch will compute
+ the ".p4i" file which contains all the API used to analyze the original written code in p4 (it's not required)
+ the ".p4info" file which contains the description of the structure used in the p4 code

To compile out p4 program we can use the command:

p4c-bm2-ss --p4v 16 -o name_file_json --p4runtime-files name_file_p4info name_file_p4

    --p4v is the version of p4 which is used
    -o is the "executable" code generated by the compiler from the .p4 file
    --p4runtime-files test.p4info.txt
    'name_file_p4' is the name of the program written in p4

(I'm consider the fact that we have already created all the interface and that all our (emulated or not) architecture is up and working...)

Now we have to run our program and to do it we can use the command:
```bash
$ sudo simple_switch_grpc --log-console --no-p4 --device-id 1 -i 1@eth1 -i 2@eth2 --thrift-port 9090 -- --grpc-server-addr localhost:50051 --cpu-port 255
```

To instantiate a software switch (this one is based on the serialization protocol GRPC) in localhost on port 50051, with controller port 255, connected to the interface eth1 and eth2 of our machine (vm RELEASE, mind that the interfaces can change their numbers, depending from the provisioning), with some logs and the thrift port to interact with the switch from outside.

We have also the control plan in another python file which set some configurations (which are outscope the p4 language), to run it:

```bash
$ cd Customer-Edge-Switch/orchestrator && sudo python3 orchestrator.py
```
