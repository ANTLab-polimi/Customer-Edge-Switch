To create a certificate, you need to use the openssl software.
One of the possible source is: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/create-a-self-signed-tls-certificate/

The comand to digit is:
>> openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key

Where:

-newkey rsa:4096: Create a 4096 bit RSA key for use with the certificate.

-x509: Create a self-signed x509 certificate 

-sha256: Generate the certificate request using 256-bit SHA

-days: Determines the length of time in days that the certificate is being issued for

-nodes: Create a certificate that does not require a passphrase.
        If this option is excluded, you will be requesred to enter the passphrase in the console each time the application using it is restarted

For other option:
>> man openssl


For our goal: we want to have a mutual TLS connection between the AUSF node and the SDN controller.
So, we need two couple of certificate and key.
